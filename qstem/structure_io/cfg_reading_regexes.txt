For reading cell dimensions:

Extract the two numbers in the parenthesis, and the floating point number that follows.
H0\((\d),(\d)\) = (\d+\.\d+)\s*

You won't get matches for indices that don't have entries - this RE requires that a decimal point be present.
Thus, all of the entries that are simply 0 are skipped.  Still, you should later check the returned results and keep
only those in which the first two indices are identical.

For reading the atomic coordinates:
# This regex is designed to capture 3 things:
- the atomic number entry
- the chemical symbol
- the block of text containing the atomic coordinate, DW-factor, occ, and charge entries

# find atomic number at beginning of line, followed by symbol:
^([\d]+)\s*\n([A-Za-z]{1,2})\s*\n

# match everything after the start, but don't be greedy (stop before consuming absolutely everything):
(.*?)

# termination:
# either match the start of a new atom (without consuming it, with the ?= lookahead assertion),
#    or the end of the string/file (\Z):
(?=^\d+\s*\n\s*\w+\s*\n|\Z)

# In combination:
(\d+)\s*\n([A-Za-z]{1,2})\s*\n (.*?) (?=\d+\s*\n\s*[A-Za-z]{1,2}\s*\n|\Z)

# in Python, need to make sure that '.' matches newlines also in order to grab multiple lines:
e = re.compile("(\d+)\s*\n([A-Za-z]{1,2})\s*\n(.*?)(?=\d+\s*\n\s*[A-Za-z]{1,2}\s*\n|\Z)", flags=re.M|re.S)
